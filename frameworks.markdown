This is the **Kerbal Space Program Frameworks** section of the suite. These mods are typically dependencies of the rest of the mods and provide supporting code and functions that make them work at all. 

These mods are almost always provided as hard dependencies - removing or disabling them will make the game work incorrectly. You have been warned.
